# js-calculator

This is a project to make my own calculator

Project goals:

1. A working Calculator: The main task is to create a Calculator not only will this test your
understanding of JavaScript but how you break down a problem.

2. Practice using Git and GitHub flow: We want you to get as much practice as possible
using git, GitHub and the command line.

3. Apply what you are learning: This is a great place to apply what you have been learning
on all of the course so far. When you get it functioning really push on the UI, use SCSS,
BEM, anything else you find on the web....really go mad!

Requirements
1. You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub - DONE!

2. In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project - DONE!
    2a. We expect at least 10 Git commits for the different stages in your development. - DONE!

3. Accept a minimum of 2 inputs, perform an operation and return the output. - DONE!

4. DO NOT USE THE eval() function as this is extremely dangerous. - I HAVEN'T!

5. Beware of following a “How to make a calculator in JS tutorial”. Watching a video is not
the same as learning to code. Some of the stuff you’ll have to do we won’t have covered
so If you can’t explain it or don’t understand it, you can’t use it. - I DIDN'T!

6. We would like you to take a Mobile first approach to the implementation. It needs to
work on different device widths. - I DID!
